Q) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MYSQL AND NOSQL
   1) Structure:
       - MySQL is a relational database that uses a tabular structure, where data is stored in tables with
         predefined schemas.
        - NoSQL databases are non-relational and use flexible data structures such as documents, key-value
         pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores.
   2) Scalability:
        - MySQL is vertically scalable, meaning it can handle increased load by increasing the power of the
         hardware.
        - NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle increased load by adding more
         nodes or servers.
   3) Schema:
         - MySQL requires a detailed database model before creation, whereas NoSQL databases do not need a 
         predefined schema.
   4) Query Language:
        - MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data.
        - NoSQL databases use different query languages depending on the type of database, such as MongoDB's 
        query language for document stores.
   5) Community and Support:
        - MySQL has a large and established community with extensive support resources.
        - NoSQL databases have smaller communities and less established support networks, but are still 
        widely used and supported.
   6) Use Cases:
        - MySQL is suitable for applications that require complex transactions, multi-row operations, and 
        strict data consistency.
        - NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that handle large amounts of unstructured or
         dynamic data, such as social media platforms, content management systems, or real-time analytics.

    In summary, MySQL is a traditional relational database that excels in structured data management and
     complex transactions, while NoSQL databases offer flexibility and scalability for handling large amounts
      of unstructured data.
