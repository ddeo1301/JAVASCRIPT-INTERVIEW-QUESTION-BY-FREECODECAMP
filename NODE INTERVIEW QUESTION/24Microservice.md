Q) what is microservice
- Microservices in Node.js is a way to build applications by breaking them down into smaller, independent parts that work together. Instead of having one big program that does everything, you have many smaller programs that each do one specific thing really well.

- These smaller programs are called microservices. Each microservice is its own little application with its own code, database, and way of communicating with other microservices. They are loosely coupled, which means they don't depend on each other too much

- To build a microservice with Node.js, you typically:
    - Break down your application into smaller, independent services.
    - Use Node.js frameworks like Express, Fastify, or NestJS to build each microservice.
    - Have each microservice communicate with others through APIs.
    - Deploy each microservice independently, so you can update or scale them separately
